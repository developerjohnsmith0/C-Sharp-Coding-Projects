# C-Sharp-Coding-Projects
There are some Projects I made using C# and .NET framework.

## Projects

- Blackjack Game
- Car Insurance

## Blackjack Game

This project is a Blackjack allowing to play 1 to 7 players at a time.

## Car Insurance

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote bases on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
